# Concept-Compilations--Public-
Concepts and Ideas that I already abandoned

//THIS REPOSITORY IS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE OLD CONCEPT REPOSITORIY

This is an archive of all projects that I thought had potential.

Most of these projects have major flaws so I'm not actively trying to develop most of it.
The projects I'm currently working on will be located in (Concept-Compilations-Private)

(My memory only have around 50 bytes of storage so I had to make something like this)

Anybody interested in working with any of the ideas in this repository is free to do so. 

Also, if anyone is interested in working with me on my current private projects, Contact me @ (vnncoo@gmail.com)
