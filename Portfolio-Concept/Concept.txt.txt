The idea is to make a Portfolio including FAANG concepts and designs in their products.

For Facebook:
I will make the main interface using the design of Instagram
Instagram looks better than Facebooks design (for me).

For Amazon:
I will make an API connect from twitter that gets the ratings of the user through twitter comments
I will then forward the data to the website and design the ratings like Amazon ratings (somehow).

For Apple:
I will make a settings that looks like the nav-bar of the iPhone.
A transparent navbar that has blur and such.

For Netflix:
For the Projects part, I will make a netflix type information slider
Will also design it to show texts when hovered by.

For Google:
I will design a loading animation in the beginning
The loading will basically go like I was typing my name on google then transition to the Main interface.
